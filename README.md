[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/usabilla/api-js-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/usabilla/api-js-node?branch=master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/usabilla/api-js-node/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/usabilla/api-js-node?branch=master)

The Usabilla API Client for Node.js provides access to the Usabilla database from Node.js applications.

The client has the following features:
* Getting the buttons / campaigns / widgets / forms as well as the feedback they contain.
* Querying over the feedback with different parameters.

## Authentication

The client uses extensive authentication based on a request signing process. For more information,
please see our [developers guide](http://developers.usabilla.com)

## Getting started

Install node client through npm

```bash
$ npm install usabilla-api --save
```

### Usage

An example that displays the number of buttons:

```js
const Usabilla = require('usabilla-api');
const usabilla = new Usabilla('YOUR-ACCESS-KEY', 'YOUR-SECRET-KEY');

usabilla.websites.buttons.get().then((buttons) => {
  console.log('Number of buttons: ', buttons.length);
}).catch((reason) => {
  console.error(reason);
});
```

See the code in the [example folder](https://github.com/usabilla/api-js-node/tree/master/example) for more advanced ideas on how to use the client.
